Simply one of the most cozy games I've ever played. At times I got bored, but the story builds very well over time. It's a great game.

An absurdly beautiful game Annapurna knows how to make good games. The beginning of the game is absurdly cool, it's innovative, but the second part starts to get a little boring and monotonous, but the third... The third is perfect. I would say it's a relaxing game, with fun puzzles.
